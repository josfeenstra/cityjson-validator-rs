# dry-cityjson-validator 

A pure rust implementation of a (city) json validator.






# considerations

- Code should be able to run from wasm, and 'on dry land' using the normal cli.
- Lets do this formally, like the rust book tells us!


# run 
```

validator.exe [absolute path to schema] [absolute path to cityjson file] 

```
