# dry-cityjson-validator 

A pure rust implementation of a (city) json validator.






## considerations

- Code should be able to run both from wasm, and 'on dry land' using the normal cli.
- I am very new to rust, so i'm trying to do this 'by the book' as much as possible.


## run 
```

validator.exe [absolute path to schema] [absolute path to cityjson file]

```
